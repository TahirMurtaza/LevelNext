          This logo is designed with the concept of different <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Khidmat"</span> performed
          by Burhani Guards(BG). As per the vision of Burhani Guards Idara, our
          main aim is to bring mumineen closer to Aqa Moula (T.U.S.). To achieve
          this we must be ready to do Next Level <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Khidmat"</span> and for that we must prepare ourselves in advance,for which this camp serves as training. Thus<span class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> “Level Next”</span>, the camp slogan indicates this desire on our part to train and groom ourselves so that we are better prepared in serving Aqa Moula (T.U.S.).
        </p>
        <p>The different features of the logo are described below:</p>
        <p>
          The logo’s outer circle contains a rope with 22 stars. The 22 stars
          indicates the 22 divisions in Zone <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">‘E’</span> of Burhani Guards Idara whereas
          the design of stars is taken from the Ranks given in BG. All stars are
          connected with a single rope that indicates the connectivity of all
          divisions with the platform of BG. The color used in outer circle is
          green which is the same as used in ranks beneath stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Burhani Guards is written on top of inner circle with <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Level Next"</span>; the
          camp slogan written beneath. We are honored to have <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Burhani"</span> in our
          name which associates us with 52 nd Dai ul Mutlaq, Syedna Muhammad
          Burhanuddin(R.A.). A logo of this year’s Milad Mubarak has been placed
          below this.
        </p>
        <p>
          In center, we have placed map of Pakistan which portrays Burhani Guards
          Idara Zone <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">‘E’</span>. A Book is placed in maps center as it’s the source of
          Knowledge. Every division is like a page in a book which is strongly
          bound together. Every page has its two sides, “Deen and Duniyah”, and
          members of BG perform khidmat in both aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          One complete page of the book is illustrated in emblem. On the right
          hand side page, there are logos of <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Hifz Ul Quran"</span> and <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Tadrees"</span>. These
          two are decree of our beloved Moula who wishes that there is a Hafiz in
          each and every home and that all mumineen should complete Nisaab 1 and 2
          asbaaq. The left hand page shows <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Camping"</span> and <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Project Rise"</span> logos. We
          decided to illustrate these two out of the many choices that are for
          <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Duniyah"</span> as currently these two aspects are the most relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logo of Burhani Guards Pakistan is placed below the book on right side
          whereas Inter division competition camp and it’s dates are written in
          bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The theme <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"LEVEL NEXT"</span> for Burhani guards indicates that BGs are
          stepping forward in khidmat of Aqa Moula (T.U.S.). As we all know, it’s
          a wish of Aqa Moula (T.U.S.) that each and every momin should take
          asbaaq regularly. We, BGs are also taking Asbaaq and with the help of
          Asbaaq, <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"the right knowledge"</span> and Maarefat of Aqa Moula (T.U.S.), we are
          achieving <span class="font-weight-bold">LEVEL NEXT</span> in khidmat.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          By the Dua Mubarak of Aqa Moula (T.U.S.), and knowledge and training,
          Burhani guards is getting stronger in their souls. It’s a necessary
          requirement of khidmat in this Era when information is available on
          figertips. Sajdaat ut Shukar in Hazrat Imamiyah Nooraniyah for this
          azeem nemat of getting RAZA for the ILM of AALE MOHAMMED S.A.
